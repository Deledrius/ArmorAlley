** Changelog / Revision History

+ V1.5.20180201

 + Big feature updates!
  ‚Ä¢ Game "mostly" now works on mobile devices. Touch-based events for helicopter control, UI for helicopter weapons and inventory / ordering. Tested on iPhone X. Others should work reasonably-well. Hopefully.
  ‚Ä¢ Inventory order queueing! üéâ (Finally.) e.g., 3 tanks in a row. Queueing deducts funds immediately. No added UI or cancel ability (yet.)
  ‚Ä¢ Battlefield view is now bigger on screen. Stats UI is dead, long live stats.
  ‚Ä¢ Performance improvements. tl;dr: JavaScript tweaks, putting most all sprites onto the GPU. Replaced most common animated .GIF backgrounds with 3d-transform, GPU-accelerated CSS animation-driven sprites. üòÖ

 + Sound
  ‚Ä¢ No sound for any Safari (desktop or mobile) for now, including version 11.0. Multiple sounds kill performance on desktop, and "auto-play" is effectively blocked on mobile. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116145
  ‚Ä¢ New + improved helicopter machine gun sounds. 9 different samples, played at random.
  ‚Ä¢ New sound effects: "bomb hatch" (helicopter bomb release), tank gunfire, bunker chain/balloon repair, helicopter gunfire hit.
  ‚Ä¢ "Medals clanking" sound for bunker chain/balloon repair. (BY-NC 3.0.) https://freesound.org/people/Gareth_H/sounds/365799/
  ‚Ä¢ New tank gunfire sound: "Tank Fire Mixed.wav" by Cyberkineticfilms/freesound.org (CC0, "No Rights Reserved". üôá)
  ‚Ä¢ Hat tip: "Bolo" "tank self hit" sound effect, Copyright (C) Steuart Cheshire 1993. My favourite Mac game of all time. ‚ù§Ô∏è

 + UX / UI
  ‚Ä¢ "Radar jammed" TV static-like overlay with transform sprite.
  ‚Ä¢ Slightly faster helicopter bombing rate - more responsive.
  ‚Ä¢ Chain refactor. Use fixed height, animate via transform, fall with gravity when balloon and/or bunker are lost.
  ‚Ä¢ Balloons are yellow-ish on radar, and now transform-rotated to elliptical shapes. Bunkers / base color and border tweaks, friendly vs. enemy now look different.
  ‚Ä¢ Inventory and helicopter ammo, etc., become greyed out when unaffordable / unavailable.
  ‚Ä¢ Target / "tracking" animation on Smart Missile targets.
  ‚Ä¢ Smart Missiles can now re-target on the next frame after the original target dies. If a new target can not be immediately acquired, the Smart Missile dies as previously.
  ‚Ä¢ Radar items, clouds and some other sprites move more smoothly simply by dropping `parseInt()`.
  ‚Ä¢ "C" / rubber chicken use causes UI to switch to rubber chicken mode.
  ‚Ä¢ Possible bugfix: If paused and enemy order timer fires, re-start timer. This probably fixes enemy inventory building sometimes breaking.
  ‚Ä¢ Jam radar all the time on hard + extreme game types.

 + Miscellany
  ‚Ä¢ Note re: Firefox `will-change` memory consumption warning that might show in console.
  ‚Ä¢ URL feature flags: `noTranslate3d` and `noRadarGPU`. `frameRate=[60|*]` for testing of `requestAnimationFrame()` timing. camelCase others. Let Opera (now webkit-based) have transforms.
  ‚Ä¢ +`makeTransformSprite()`, a sort of sub-sprite for CSS transform-based animations (GPU-accelerated animated .GIF alternatives.)
  ‚Ä¢ `z-index: -1` can be harmful for performance / compositing.
  ‚Ä¢ iPhone X notch handling based on orientation and whatnot.
